# Half Adder RTL Design

This project is a basic implementation of a Half Adder using the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). It demonstrates a complete digital design flow, including RTL coding, verification via simulation, synthesis, and timing analysis using Intel Quartus Prime.

1. Specification
Objective: To design a half adder circuit with two 1-bit inputs (A, B) and two 1-bit outputs (SUM, CARRY).
